title: Village of Hobart Unveils Marketplace Plan for Centennial Centre at Hobart
---

*Springboarding from unprecedented residential growth, the Build in Hobart initiative seeks to fulfill commercial development.*

The Village of Hobart is on track to realize the Wisconsin Department of Administration’s projection of 76% population growth through 2040 which will make it the fastest growing community in the state. To support the 7,600 current village residents and those from greater Green Bay, as well as to attract visitors from neighboring Wisconsin communities, commercial development will need to keep pace with residential growth. To that end, the village undertook a massive planning effort with Vierbicher, a Madison consulting firm, for the marketplace component of Centennial Centre at Hobart. That plan is available at [buildinhobart.com](http://buildinhobart.com).

In four short years, Centennial Centre at Hobart has transformed from a farm field to 445 occupied living units with an additional 150 under contract for construction in the coming year; two light manufacturers employing 200; a 52-unit assisted living complex; and more. Tax Incremental District (TID) #1 in the Village of Hobart has increased valuation by $67 million to date during one of the worst economies in some time. From 2013 to 2014 alone, valuation increased by 26%. Finishing touches are on a development agreement for an $18 million residential complex (Hobart Crossing) set to begin construction in the coming weeks. This will be the start of the marketplace plan and reinforces the continued explosive growth. The village’s theme “Greatness is Growing” is already being embraced and becoming reality.

The 100 acre parcel for the marketplace component is located within the 616 acres of Centennial Centre at Hobart. Created as the village’s first downtown central business district, the detailed master plan for Centennial Centre at Hobart calls for combining light industrial, commercial, and residential development allowing for a work-life atmosphere in a vibrant, walkable, mixed use locale. After an extensive input process from public meetings, market analysis, and work of the village board members, the final site plan emerged which concentrates retail spaces along the main Centerline Drive and around a central village green, all framed by mixed-use buildings. There will be two anchor stores with one projected to be a grocery store.

The Village of Hobart has already taken innovative approaches to begin the process of soliciting commercial businesses including cable television advertising and targeted online efforts. Business owners and developers looking to expand or begin a business in the Fox Valley/greater Green Bay area are the target demographic. Resident input revealed the following areas of greatest request: grocery store, bakery, deli, liquor store, cheese shop and retailers of clothing, home goods, hardware, pharmacy; specialties such as electronics; and convenience and gas stations. For restaurants, the village is seeking pizzerias; coffee shops; sub shops; ice cream parlors; upscale, casual, and family oriented restaurants.

Equally important to open soon are service-oriented businesses including a hotel, bank, dry cleaner, salon, spa, accountant, vehicle repair, fitness center, dentist, and medical clinic. A day care, established in 2014, went from being a great need to open for business within eight months. That is a testament to the tax incentives, fast track approval process, and recognized instant customer base offered by the Village of Hobart.

During development of the marketplace, walkability and green space will be recurring themes. Parks, walk/bike paths, and trails already in place will get a boost with a village green and expanded trail system with more parks.

Centennial Centre at Hobart was formally launched in mid-2009 to bring long-term, economic sustainability to a one-hundred year old area dominated by high-income residential neighborhoods and multigenerational farms. The mixed-use area is located along the state highway 29/32 corridor and serves as the western gateway of the greater Green Bay metro area.
